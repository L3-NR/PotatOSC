# PotatOSC
Optimized, bare bones VRC OSC media status in C#

## Why?
I have a shitty CPU, so i tought this would be a 'fun' project to do.

## How?
Most of the code was generated by GPT4 and GPT3.5 lol.

If you have any idea on how to make it more optimized or find a bug, please tell me, because I am not really experienced with C#.

### Command to build:
dotnet publish -p:PublishSingleFile=true -p:PublishTrimmed=true -p:ApplicatinIcon=potatosc.ico -r win-x64 -c Release --self-contained true

### What it does:
Grabs the currently playing media (same as displayed on the volume control), then sends an OSC message to VRChat. Works with stuff like youtube music and spotify, but also probably most other media players.

### How to get it:
Head on over to https://github.com/L3-NR/PotatOSC/releases and grab PotatOSC.exe

### How to make it a startup app:
Place the .exe (or a shortcut to it) into C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp

### How to make it indexed in windows search:
Place the .exe (or a shortcut to it) into C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs
